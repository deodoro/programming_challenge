The purpose of the challenge was to identify the delay average for each country and regions over the years to 
visualize which country improved or regressed. 

My script was coded in order of the questions assigned in the challenge.
By step 5 CSV files will be written with the results so hit RUN button should
make the script work. 

My powerBI report works by loading in the 3 CSV files results from the script 
and filtered data set.
There is a vertical box that allows to select year and a drop down box to select country.
These slicers should help in filtering the data when viewing the plots.

An assumption I made is that very hot and cold countries will experience the highest 
delay on average compared to normal temp countries because extreme weather may affect 
people's energy and body temp.
